1. NLLS Benchmark 
	Change directory to Examples/SimpleCERESComparison.
	If data needs to be recreated:
		Ensure that Opt's q_tolerance is set to 0
		Ensure that initial trust region radius is set to 1e4 for both CERES and Opt
		Ensure "API/src/solverGPUGaussNewton.t" has "use_cusparse" and "use_fused_jtj" set to false
		Ensure that all problems are set to run in main.cpp
		Compile and Run the release version of the Simple program
		Change the problems set to run in main.cpp to just boxbod
		Ensure that initial trust region radius is set to 2e5 for both CERES and Opt
		Compile and Run the release version of the Simple program
	Run "python generateResultSummary.py; python generateIterationGraphSources.py; python generatePlots.py"
	The plots will be in the "plots/" subdirectory; copy them over to your paper directory and use them (latex code for putting the graphs in the paper will be made by hand)

2. Timing for all problems (float OptGN)
	Ensure "../results" exists
	Change directory to "scripts/"
	Run "python runPaperExamples.py > ../results/allResults.txt"
	Extract timing by inspection from allResults.txt 
	Put timing info into paper

3. CERES Iteration/Time comparison for 4 problems (float/double OptGN/OptLM) and scaling
	Change directory to "scripts/"
	Run "python generateAllPerformanceResults.py [pascalOrBetterGPU]" with the argument set to true if on a pascal or better gpu
	All results will be in "results/"
	Run "python generateIterationTimePlots.py"
	The plots will be in the "scripts/plots/" subdirectory copy them over to your paper directory and use them

4. Cusparse Comparison
	Change directory to "scripts/"
	Run "python cusparseComparison.py"
	extract timing by inspection from "results/cusparseTiming_*.txt"
	Put timing info into paper


Alternatively, combined steps 2-4:
2-4. Timing for all problems (float OptGN)
	Change directory to "scripts/"
	Run "python generateAllPerformanceResults.py [pascalOrBetterGPU];python runPaperExamples.py > ../results/allResults.txt;python generateIterationTimePlots.py;python cusparseComparison.py" with the argument set to true if on a pascal or better gpu
	Extract timing by inspection from results/allResults.txt and results/cusparseTiming_*.txt, 
	Copy the plots from scripts/plots/ into the pap
	Put timing info into paper
