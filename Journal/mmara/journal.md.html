Brought all versions of ShapeFromShading online. Current status:

CUDA (block solver only): *Increases* cost
Terra: Seems to work fairly well
Terra AD: NaNs are propagating.

Things to do next: switch terra versions to non-blocked version. Write non-blocked CUDA version. Debug AD version.

Added areWeBroken.sh, which is meant to be a one-button regression test. Right now, just compiles and runs the known-good samples.

Working towards getting Shape From Shading online, added new documentation to aid future versions of myself in that process.
